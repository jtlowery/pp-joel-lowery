# Prediction problem for Joel Lowery 

The purpose of the task is to demonstrate your skillset, and how you would approach a prediction problem.

We would like you to build a predictive model for a given house selling, given the data set and using Python or R.

This can be a quick and dirty model. 

Approximately 5% of the rows have y=1, so the dataset is unbalanced.
